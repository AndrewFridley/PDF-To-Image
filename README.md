### About
A simple app built with React.js and electron.

### Instructions

2. Drag a pdf file over the dropzon until it turns green.
3. Drop the pdf file and a .png file of the same name will be created in the same folder as the dropped .pdf file.

### Bugs
Currently the windows version is experienceing issues with GraphicsMagick for Node. 
One can drag .pdf's on to convert them and it will try to but you will get a png with a file size of 0.
for now the windows version is more of a UI showcase then anything else.
